# Network-Simulation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This is a **Java-based command-line project** that simulates two fundamental network routing algorithms:

- **Distance Vector Algorithm**
- **Link State Algorithm**

The project operates with **static, hardcoded topology data** and **displays routing tables and shortest paths** directly in the console. It provides a practical comparison of how these algorithms work internally and how they compute efficient paths in a network.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Simulate routing tables and shortest paths using:
  - Distance Vector Algorithm (via Bellman-Ford logic)
  - Link State Algorithm (via Dijkstraâ€™s logic)
- Use a predefined network graph (no runtime input)
- Display output clearly through the terminal
- Highlight functional differences between the two algorithms

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- **Java** (Core Logic)
- **Console Output** for all results
- Java Collections: `HashMap`, `ArrayList`, etc.
